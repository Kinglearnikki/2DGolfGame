Get ready for a 2D golfing experience! Use your mouse to direct the ball and adjust your power. The objective of the game is to complete each hole in as few strokes and little time as possible while navigating through courses with varying obstacles that become more complex with each level.
Golfing will be pretty simple but different terrains and obstacles like sand traps, water hazards, and various walls affect your ball differently, requiring a different strategy. Starting on an easier course, the difficulty ramps up with each level, introducing more challenging terrains and obstacles.
